    "One of Fugue's core philosophies is adapting to data practitioners to let them define their logic in the most grammar they are most comfortable with. In some cases, native Python is the most natural way to express operations. By abstracting framework-specific code, we can focus on the pure business logic. We can also frame the problems in a scale-agnostic way.\n",

    "In effect, this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* reduces boilerplate code\n",
    "* reduces framework lock-in\n",
    "* increases maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "With Fugue, your mindset is focused on the logical problem you are solving, not the tools you have to decide from."

In these cases, the Pandas version is often highly tested and stable, so we should just use that rather than reinventing the wheel. It also helps operationally when the business logic changes."

Second, the logic can be unit tested without having the needed cluster. Users can iterate as much as possible on the local machine. "
