We can choose to only bring the necessary step to a cluster, saving money.\n",

Fugue can be used to keep the code native, and also let users avoid having to maintain a Pandas implementation, and a Spark implementation. In these cases, the Pandas version is often highly tested and stable, so we should just use that rather than reinventing the wheel. It also helps operationally when the business logic changes."

Second, the logic can be unit tested without having the needed cluster. Users can iterate as much as possible on the local machine. "
