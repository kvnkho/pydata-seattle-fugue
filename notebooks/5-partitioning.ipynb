    "Partitioning is one of the fundamental concepts in distributed computing. In the local setting, all of the data fits in one machine. In the distributed setting, the data is spread across multiple machines, and often has to be moved around to perform an operation (which is called a shuffle). There is a subtle but importance difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a groupby-mean can be done without moving the data around. We can do the groupby-mean per machine, and then aggregate the results further. On the other hand, a groupby-median can not be done distributedly. It will require some form of collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fugue abstracts the partitioning to make it easy so that users have to worry about it less. Still, it's important to know this concept to leverage distributed computing effectively."

    "In the previous section, we ended with a scikit-learn pipeline that was applied for each group of data. When you data a big dataset, there is a high chance that there are logical grouping within. Can we tackle the problem per user? per region? per item in a store? It's very common to see that machine learning models for one region may not translate well for another region. It's also very common to have data stored in the same column that may be different units (currencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we break up big data into a small problems, we can focus on the logic for one group of data, iterate quickly, and then scale with Fugue."
